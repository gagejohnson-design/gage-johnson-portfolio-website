        <h2>Fullstack Academy</h2>
        <img src="img/dev.png" alt="Developer Image" />
        <p>
          At Fullstack Academy, I’ve developed a strong foundation in modern web
          development through hands-on, project-based learning centered on
          building responsive, user-focused applications. My work has included
          designing clean, accessible interfaces using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, as well as applying version control best practices with
          Git and GitHub to manage collaborative workflows. These projects have
          emphasized writing maintainable code, breaking down complex problems,
          and iterating quickly based on feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to frontend development, I’ve gained experience connecting
          client-side applications to backend services and APIs, strengthening
          my understanding of how data flows through full-stack systems. By
          building and deploying multi-page and single-page applications, I’ve
          learned how to structure projects for scalability, performance, and
          long-term maintainability, simulating real-world development
          environments and professional engineering standards.

        <h2>AWS</h2>
        <img src="img/Cloud.png" alt="Cloud Image" />
        <p>
          Through my AWS studies, I’ve focused on designing and deploying
          secure, cloud-based architectures using core services such as S3,
          CloudFront, EC2, IAM, and VPC. I’ve practiced building environments
          that prioritize availability, performance, and security, while gaining
          hands-on experience with identity management, permissions, and network
          segmentation to protect and control access across systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked on automating deployment and infrastructure workflows
          using GitHub Actions and configuration-driven approaches, reinforcing
          best practices around CI/CD and infrastructure as code concepts. This
          experience has helped me understand how to balance cost optimization,
          monitoring, and scalability while building cloud solutions that can
          support production-level applications.

        <h2>Consulting</h2>
        <img src="img/consulting.png" alt="Consulting Image" />
        <p>
          In my professional role, I’ve worked as a data and systems consultant
          supporting enterprise SaaS implementations and large-scale data
          migration projects across multiple business units. I collaborate
          closely with business stakeholders to translate complex operational
          requirements into structured technical designs, building ETL-driven
          workflows and integration strategies that improve data quality,
          reliability, and system interoperability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside technical delivery, I’ve played a key role in documentation,
          validation, and cross-team communication to ensure solutions are
          aligned with both business goals and technical constraints. This work
          has strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between engineering
          teams and non-technical partners, while delivering scalable,
          well-governed systems that support long-term organizational growth.
