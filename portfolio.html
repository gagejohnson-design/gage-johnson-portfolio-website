          At Fullstack Academy, I’ve developed a strong foundation in modern web
          development through hands-on, project-based learning centered on
          building responsive, user-focused applications. My work has included
          designing clean, accessible interfaces using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, as well as applying version control best practices with
          Git and GitHub to manage collaborative workflows. These projects have
          emphasized writing maintainable code, breaking down complex problems,
          and iterating quickly based on feedback.

          Through my AWS studies, I’ve focused on designing and deploying
          secure, cloud-based architectures using core services such as S3,
          CloudFront, EC2, IAM, and VPC. I’ve practiced building environments
          that prioritize availability, performance, and security, while gaining
          hands-on experience with identity management, permissions, and network
          segmentation to protect and control access across systems.

          In my professional role, I’ve worked as a data and systems consultant
          supporting enterprise SaaS implementations and large-scale data
          migration projects across multiple business units. I collaborate
          closely with business stakeholders to translate complex operational
          requirements into structured technical designs, building ETL-driven
          workflows and integration strategies that improve data quality,
          reliability, and system interoperability.
